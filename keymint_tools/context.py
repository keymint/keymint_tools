class Context(AttrDict):
    """
    Encapsulate a set of configurations for a particular context.

    This is used by the build and build_pkg verbs, for example, to encapsulate
    the build configurations like build space location, and whether or not to
    install.

    The Context can be extended by setting attributes directly, but a
    :py:class:`ContextExtender` can be used to modify a Context using a
    defined pattern, one of: add, replace, or extend.
    This prevents every actor who modifies a Context from reimplementing the
    boilerplate for these patterns.

    You can access members of the Context as a dictionary and/or as an object:

    .. code:: python

        >>> c = Context()
        >>> c['foo'] = 'bar'
        >>> print(c['foo'])
        bar
        >>> print(c.foo)
        bar
        >>> c.ping = 'pong'
        >>> print(c.ping)
        pong
        >>> print(c['ping'])
        pong

    The object attribute based access makes it more convenient to access
    configurations and the dictionary style access makes it more convenient to
    programatically extend.

class ContextExtender:
    """
    Store a series of extensions for a Context which can be applied later.

    This can be used to describe a series of extensions (add, replace,
    or extend) which can later be applied to a Context.
    This decouples the intent of the changes from the actual changes, allowing
    different sources of changes which may conflict to be resolved later by
    a common actor with access to the Context and all ContextExtender's.

    In the context of the BuildType concept, this is used to allow a BuildType
    interface to describe how it would like to alter the build Context without
    giving it direct access.
    This is important to prevent accidental cross talk between providers of
    Context extensions.

    This is a typical example of how you might use a ContextExtender:

    .. code:: python

        >>> from ament_tools.context import Context
        >>> from ament_tools.context import ContextExtender
        >>> c = Context()
        >>> ce = ContextExtender()
        >>> ce.add('foo', 'bar')
        >>> # You cannot add an items a second time (add must be a new key)
        >>> ce.add('foo', 'cant add this a second time!')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
          File "ament_tools/context.py", line 137, in add
            "Context key '{0}' will already exist.".format(key)
        ament_tools.context.ContextAddExtensionException: Context key 'foo' will already exist.
        >>> ce.replace('foo', 'bar2')
        >>> ce.extend('foo', 'bar3')
        >>> ce.extensions
        [['add', 'foo', 'bar'], ['replace', 'foo', 'bar2'], ['extend', 'foo', 'bar3']]
        >>> ce.apply_to_context(c)
        >>> c.items()
        [('foo', 'bar2bar3')]

    You must also make sure extend is called with compatible value types:

    .. code:: python

        >>> ce2 = ContextExtender()
        >>> ce2.extend('foo', ['bar4'])
        >>> ce2.apply_to_context(c)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
          File "ament_tools/context.py", line 119, in apply_to_context
            context[key] += value
        TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'list' objects

    In the above case this error happens because the current value for ``foo``
    is a ``str``, but the value given for the ``extend`` action is a ``list``.
